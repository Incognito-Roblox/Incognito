## Background
Originally, this project was a maintained private and unfinished build of *Incognito*. It was subsequently leaked privately to a few, who utilized it without our consent to profit from our work.

However, following a public leak, we have decided to officially release the latest unleaked version of the code to prevent the spread of potentially modified, unsafe versions.

This repository is a resource for learning and understanding. We hope that by making this code available, we can support the community in using and improving their own software safely and effectively.
